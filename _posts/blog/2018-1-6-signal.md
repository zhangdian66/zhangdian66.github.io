Each signal has a default action, which a process default does when it receives
corresponding singal. SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 both has the default action TERM.

##SIGTERM VS SIGKILL
It is the same question the difference between kill and kill -9.
If we use kill 1000, the process 1000 receives SIGTERM.Once the process receive
the notice, there are three ways the process can do:

* stop immediately
* wait a minute and release resources
* ignore

The appication will determine which action it wants to do when a SIGTERM is
received. But SIGKILL (kill -9) cannot be ignored by the process.In fact, SIGKILL
goes straight to init. And init will stop the process, the process will never gets
the opportunity to catch the signal. There are several situations the process cannot 
be successfully killed.

* waiting for disk IO or network IO
* zombie process
* process in an interruptible sleep
