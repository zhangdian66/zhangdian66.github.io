I have to write my blog in English, because it's too difficult to switch Chinese
and English using putty.

How to setup personal blog.<br>
1: Check [DomainCompare][compare] to choose a suitable domain provider. For 
personal usage, I recommend namesilo with free WHOIS privacy.<br>
2: To speed up DNS name resolution in China, please change the dns provider 
to dnspod. To take advantage of the personal domain, we can redirect subdomain 
blog.domain.com to github pages.<br>
3: Install ruby, nodejs and jekyll in Linux machine. For example:
```
apt-get install ruby nodejs jekyll
```
Create a new folder to store basic jekyll files.
```
jekyll new blog
```
Run command `jekyll serve` to run. But the default server can be only access by
localhost browser. If you want to browse the page from another machine, run 
command `jekyll serve -w --host=0.0.0.0 &`.<br>
After test the blog in local, we can push the code to remote repo in github.
